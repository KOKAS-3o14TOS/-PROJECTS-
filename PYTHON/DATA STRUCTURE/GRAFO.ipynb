    "# GRAFO o GRAPH \n",
    "\n",
    "In a Graph, set of nodos or vetices and these nodes are connected with each other with the help of some edges. The nodes or vertices are used to store data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A graph is a type of non-linear data strcuture that is used to store data in formm of nodo and edges. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"IMG/GRAFO.png\"></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "Example\n",
    " Graph having a set of vertices as V = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}\n",
    " Edges as E = {1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-1, 2-5, 3-1, 3-4, 3-5, 4-1, 4-3, 5-2, 5-3}\n",
    "\n",
    "## Properties \n",
    "Distance between vertices: \n",
    "It is the minimum number of edges present between two nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Distance between vertices: \n",
    "The eccentricity is defined as the maximum distance between a vertex to all other vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radius:\n",
    "It is the minimum eccentricity i.e. the minimum distance between a vertex to all the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Diameter: \n",
    "It is the maximum eccentricity i.e. the maximum distance between a vertex to all the vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Point: \n",
    "For a vertex, if the eccentricity of the graph is equal to its radius, then that vertex is called the central point of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Circumference: \n",
    "It is the total number of edges that are present in the longest cycle of a graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "Directed and Undirected Graph: It is a very basic type of graph. A graph can be directed or undirected i.e. the edges of a graph can be undirected or directed. In an undirected graph, for every edge, you can traverse in both the direction i.e. if there is an edge between node A and node B , then you can traverse from node A to node B or from node B to node A . But in a directed graph, the direction is given to you and you can traverse in the given direction only.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"IMG/GRAFO2.png\"></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "Weighted and Unweighted Graph: You can assign some weights or costs over an edge of a graph. If there is some weight or cost over the edges of the graph, then it is known as a weighted graph otherwise it is called an unweighted graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"IMG/GRAFO3.png\"></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "Cyclic and Acyclic Graph: If there is a cycle in a graph then that graph is called Cyclic Graph. A graph is said to have a cycle if you start from a node/vertex and after traversing some nodes, you come to the same node, then you can say that the graph is having a cycle. If there is no cycle present in the graph, then that graph is called an Acyclic Graph. For a Cyclic Graph, at least one cycle is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"IMG/GRAFO4.png\"></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "Connected and Disconnected Graph: In a Connected Graph, from each node, there is a path to all the other nodes i.e. from each node, you can access all the other nodes of the graph. But in a Disconnected Graph, you can't access all the nodes from a particular node.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"IMG/GRAFO5.png\"></center> \n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse and Dense Graph: If the number of edges of a graph is close to the total number of possible edges of that graph, then the graph is said to be Dense Graph otherwise, it is said to be a Sparse Graph.\n",
